    "For this part, we're going to explore some new somewhat strange syntax that we haven't seen in lecture. Don't panic! If you're not sure what to do, try experimenting, Googling, and don't shy away from talking to other students or course staff.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Part II:** Rather than the type you discovered in Part 1, we want each entry in `pd.TimeStamp` format. You might expect that the usual way to convert something from it current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime`. Using `pd.to_datetime`, create a new `ins['timestamp']` column containing `pd.Timestamp` objects.  These will allow us to do date manipulation with much greater ease in part 3 and part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part III:** What are the earliest and latest dates in our inspection data?  Hint: you can use `min` and `max` on dates of the correct type.\n",

If the points fall above, then the restaurants improved. If restaurants tend to improve form the first to second inspection, the scatterplot should show most of the points above the reference line. Since there is roughly the same amount of points above as below, the observations are not consistent with my expectations._"
